PECAN COCOON COOKIES
READY IN: 45mins
YIELD: 3 dozen	UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS Nutrition
1 cup butter, softened (2 sticks)
1⁄2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3⁄4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 cup pecans, finely chopped- I like mine to be almost ground
1 cup confectioners' sugar, for coating cookies
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 275.
Cream the butter and sugar until smooth.
Add vanilla, combine.
Add the flour, combine.
Mix in the pecans.
Scoop out 1 tablespoon of dough, I use a cookie/ice cream scoop, shape into into a cocoon- about 2" by 1/2".
Place the cookies on cookies sheet, you can put them fairly close together as they do not rise or spread very much.I always use parchment paper on my cookies sheets.
Bake about 45 minutes, you don't really want them to be brown.
While the cookies are baking, prepare the powdered sugar. Place some in a large bowl or container, then as you take the cookies out of the oven, layer them with powdered sugar in the bowl I just leave them in the powdered sugar until they cool.
Dig them out and tap the sugar off- this is messy but fun- I like a thick layer of sugar on mine and sifting the sugar over the cookies doesn't get them like I want.
The ones you don't eat right away keep well in an airtight container.
